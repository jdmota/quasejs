# ðŸš§ QuaseJS

This project has the objective of creating a set of useful tools to assist and help developers in common tasks.
As of now, this is just a work in progress experiment.
A lot of what is here is intended to investigate new ideas and patterns, or adapt ones that already exist, applying them to JavaScript and, possibly, in a future programming language that would provide them out of the box.
Since this is an experiment, there will be constant breaking changes.
Who knows, maybe something novel and useful might come out from this several years-old personal project.
In any case, it has been a great learning experience.

## FAQ

**What does the name mean?**

`Quase` means `almost` in portuguese. The idea was for this project to include "almost everything"... Well, one can dream right?
