# Legacy projects

This folder containts older projects that contain interesting concepts that at the time I thought were needed. Now I believe things should go in a different and more simple direction. In any case, I had fun building these. They were cool experiments that I very much learned from, and some of them were quite fun engineering challenges, so I want to keep them for memory and history purposes :)
