- Builder includes:
    - Worker farm
    - Graph
      - ComputationRegistry
    - Watcher
    - HMRServer

- Graph stores several nodes
  - All nodes are instances of GraphNode
    - ComputationDependency extends GraphNode
      - FileDependency extends ComputationDependency
      - Computation extends ComputationDependency
        - ResolveComputation extends Computation
        - TransformComputation extends Computation
  - And they connect to each other in many ways

- GraphNodes
  - May have in edges
  - May have out edges
  - It is orphan if it has zero in edges
    - Then it can be safely removed with graph.removeNode()
  - destroy() is a clean up function
    - Should remove out edges
    - Should not be called directly
  - onInEdgeAddition should be called when a new in edge is added
  - onInEdgeRemoval should be called when a in edge is removed
